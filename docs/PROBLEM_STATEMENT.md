## Theme:
**Hackathon Cyber Security: Quantum-Proof Systems**

## Background:

In the wake of rapid digitalization, banks have shifted critical applications
to public-facing environments to meet the "always-on" 24x7x365 demands of modern
customers. However, the evolution of quantum computing has introduced a systemic
vulnerability: the potential for existing cipher suites to be compromised, enabling
"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attacks where adversaries intercept encrypted
data today to decrypt it once cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs)
emerge.

## Problem Statement:

To develop a software scanner to validate deployment of
Quantum proof cipher and create cryptographic bill of material inventory for
public facing applications (Web Server, API, System)

To develop a software scanner to generate following inventory only for public facing
applications.

- Crypto inventory discovery (TLS Certificate, TLS-based VPN, APIs)
- Cryptographic controls like ciphers used, key exchange, used cipher suite and
  TLS version used, or any other which are required for public facing CBOM.

## Outcome:

- To list the Crypto inventory discovery (TLS, TLS-based VPN, APIs) which are
  exposed to Internet.
- Recommend to use quantum-safe algorithms on the public facing applications
  along with actionable for non-PQC ready.
- If the asset is already quantum safe, the "Quantum-Safe" Label should be issued.

Assets that successfully implement NIST-standardized Post-Quantum
Algorithms are used, automatically awarded a digital "Post Quantum
Cryptography (PQC) Ready" or "Fully Quantum Safe" certificate/label. This
provides immediate assurance to users that the system is shielded against future
cryptanalytic threats.
